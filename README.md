Zombie Image Placeholder Service
==================

This is the code that runs [http://placezombie.com](http://placezombie.com) and was forked from [metaltoad/memeplacer](https://github.com/metaltoad/memeplacer). So all credit really goes to them.

I really only made it so this could run on Heroku, so if you were wanting to host this on your own box, you're better off forking the [original repository](https://github.com/metaltoad/memeplacer).

If you have any suggestions please let me know, or better yet, send a pull request.
